# ST Programming

## 1 - Basic ST

The "1 - Basic ST" training is designed for beginners and those transitioning from SCL (Structured Control Language) to learn the fundamentals of ST (Structured Text) programming.

The training aims to achieve the following learning objectives:

- Understand the differences between SCL and ST: The training focuses on the key differences between the two languages, including syntax, data types, control structures, and function/block creation. This enables participants to leverage their existing knowledge in SCL and smoothly transition to ST programming in Siemens environments.
 
- Understand the configuration and structure of an ST program: The training explains the structure of an ST program, which consists of a configuration and one or more Program Organization Units (POUs). It also covers tasks, global variables, and their usage within a program.

- Understand Program Organization Units (POUs): The training explains the different types of POUs, such as programs, functions, and function blocks, and how they are used in an ST program to perform specific tasks.

- Understand the usage of namespaces and functions/function blocks: The training explains the use of namespaces to structure code into separate areas and improve reusability.

The target audience for this training includes beginners and those transitioning from SCL who already have basic knowledge in SCL programming and wish to expand their skills in ST programming in SIMATIC AX.
